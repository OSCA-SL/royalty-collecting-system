\section{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\vspace{12pt}

This is a project from \textbf{Cape Weaver Solutions} to build a \textbf{Royalty Collecting System} for \textbf{Outstanding Song Creators Association}.
This document consists of a brief description of the project, high level feature specification and the client agreement details of
Cape Weaver Solutions.
\vspace{12pt}

\section{Requirement Specification}
\vspace{12pt}
\subsection{Purpose}
\vspace{12pt}

The purpose of this project is to build a Royalty collecting system to manage royalty payments of artistes for musical events.
Royalty payments are collected for artists who are members of the OSCA when their creations are used in any way in musical events.
\vspace{12pt}

Currently this process is done manually by osca which is a very time consuming task.
The authorized person has to prepare a list of all the songs which are used in a particular event and calculate payments according to artistes.
\vspace{12pt}

The main objective of this system is to improve the efficiency and the accuracy of the royalty collecting process and also to generate monthly reports of payments.
\vspace{12pt}

\subsection{Project Scope}
\vspace{12pt}

This system solution will give the ability to create musical events by adding its songs and then calculating royalty payments for the respective member artistes of OSCA.
Also the system will generate reports of monthly payments per artist and the overall royalty collection of OSCA per month.
